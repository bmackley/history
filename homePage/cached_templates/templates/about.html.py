Cuneiform tablets were written using clay and a stylus.  Although not as efficient as modern day tablets, the documents preserved extremely well and contained important data - mostly business information from transactions between wealthy mercants. Tablets were hard to make, and so the whole tablet was utilized for writing - even the sides! </h5>\n      </div>\n      <div class="row center">\n        <a class="btn-large waves-effect waves-light amber modal-trigger" href="#modal2" >Get Started</a>\n      </div>\n      <br><br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class="container">\n    <div class="section">\n\n      <!--   Icon Section   -->\n      <div class="row">\n        <div class="col s12 m4">\n          <div class="icon-block">\n            <h2 class="center light-blue-text"><i class="large material-icons">broken_image</i></h2>\n            <h5 class="center">Seperate image based on lines</h5>\n\n            <p class="light">The first step to indexing the tablets is to seperate the images into lines.  Much like regular lined paper, Assyrians divided their tablets into lines to segement their writing.  Knowing which characters are in which line helps with indexing processes so that the text can be transliterated into a readable form.  </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class="col s12 m4">\n          <div class="icon-block">\n            <h2 class="center light-blue-text"><i class="large material-icons">crop</i></h2>\n            <h5 class="center">Crop Characters</h5>\n\n            <p class="light">Identifying hotspots is the first step for understanding these ancient documents.  Writing with a stylus on clay is much like handwriting - each person has their unique way of forming the characters, and because the characters are not uniform, a computer has a difficulty trying to determine which character is which character.  That is where human intervention is so helpful. </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class="col s12 m4">\n          <div class="icon-block">\n            <h2 class="center light-blue-text"><i class="large material-icons">select_all</i></h2>\n            <h5 class="center">Match the Character with its symbol</h5>\n\n            <p class="light">With each character identified, it has to be linked to its symbol in the Assyrian alphabet.  Since the number of people that can read Assyrian in the world is limited to a handful of people, we simplified the transliteration.  Identifying the characters is as simple as a matching game!</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n    </div>\n    <br><br>\n\n    <div class="section">\n\n    </div>\n  </div>\n    <div class = "section red lighten-5">\n      <div class="container">\n        <p> Four thousand years ago, Assyrian merchants traversed plains and crossed mountains to truck and sell goods for a profit.

They started at the top of one side, wrote all the way down, continuing around the bottom, then up the back until they arrived at the point where they started. \n      If they still needed space, they wrote in the left edge.\n\n      [appropriate pictures here]\n\n\n      Thousands of merchants were involved in the trade.
